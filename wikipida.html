    <u><h2>Early life</h2></u>
    <p>
      Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi into a Punjabi Hindu
      family. His father, Prem Nath Kohli, worked as a criminal lawyer, and his
      mother, Saroj Kohli, served as a housewife. He has an older brother,
      Vikas, and an older sister, Bhawna Kohli's formative years were spent in
      Uttam Nagar. He commenced his early education at Vishal Bharti Public
      School. According to his family, Kohli exhibited an early affinity for
      cricket as a three-year-old. He would pick up a cricket bat and request
      his father to bowl to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      On 18 December 2006, Kohli experienced the loss of his father due to a
      cerebral attack. During his childhood, his father played a crucial role in
      supporting his cricket training. Kohli has credited his father as the one
      who drove him to practice every day. He has expressed his feelings of
      missing his father's presence at times. According to his mother, Kohli's
      demeanour shifted noticeably after his father's death. He took cricket
      with newfound seriousness, prioritizing playing time and dedicating
      himself fully to the sport. Kohli's family resided in Meera Bagh, Paschim
      Vihar until the year 2015, after which they relocated to Gurgaon.

    <u><h2>Carrer</h2></u>
    <p>
      In August 2008, Kohli was included in the ODl squad for the tour of Sri
      Lanka and the Champions Trophy in Pakistan. Prior to the Sri Lankan tour,
      Kohli had limited experience, with only eight List A matches under his
      belt.[29] So, his selection was considered a "surprise call-up".[30]
      During the Sri Lankan tour, as both first-choice openers Sachin Tendulkar
      and Virender Sehwag, were unable to play due to injury, Kohli was required
      to fill the role of makeshift opener throughout the series.[31] On August
      18, 2008, Kohli made his international debut at the age of 19 in the first
      ODI of the tour, where he was dismissed for 12 runs, caught dead in front
      by an incutter from Nuwan Kulasekara.[32] However, in the fourth match of
      the series, Kohli scored his inaugural half century in the ODl format,
      with a total of fifty-four runs scored.[33]
      <p>In November 2008, Kohli was selected for inclusion in the squad for the home ODI series against England. 
        However, he was not given an opportunity to play in any of the matches.[37] In December 2008, Kohli was
         awarded a Grade D contract by the Board of Control for Cricket in India
         (BCCI) as part of the annual contract list for the Indian national team which entitled him to receive
         ₹1.5 million (equivalent to ₹4.2 million or US$50,000 in 2023). Despite being awarded a contract, in January, 
         Kohli was dropped for the five-match ODl series against Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka.</p>

    <h2>playing style</h2>
    <p>Kohli is considered as an enterprising batsman, possessing technical abilities and a dynamic playing demeanour.
       His customarily batting position in ODl cricket is at number three, with a slightly open-chested stance, and a resolute grip on the bottom handle of his bat.
       He has been noted for his agile footwork, expansive range of strokes, and his propensity for adeptly orchestrating innings whilst thriving in high-pressure situations.
        In his batting technique, Kohli tends to favour playing grounded shots rather than attempting big hits. He is appreciated for his ability to execute wrist shots and 
        his consistent prowess in the mid-wicket and cover region.</p>

 <h2>Aggression</h2>
    <p>Kohli's playing style is widely regarded as aggressive, a trait that extends to his leadership on the field. He is well known for his passionate and animated
       responses to on-field situations, demonstrating a fierce competitiveness.[55][56] His captaincy is characterized as proactive, taking bold decisions and leading the team by example.
       Kohli has been the subject of much media scrutiny and criticism in the early stages of his career. He was often portrayed as a brash and arrogant individual, eliciting mixed reactions from fans,
        critics and former cricketers alike.
        While some have praised his assertiveness and confidence, others have criticized Kohli's behaviour for crossing the boundaries of fair play and for losing control,
         sometimes resulting in a loss of composure.[62] Despite his efforts to curb his aggressive behaviour, Kohli has acknowledged that there are times when intense pressure or high-stakes situations may challenge his resolve. 
         Nevertheless, the cricketer has persistently maintained 
        that his aggression acts as a source of inspiration and drives his focus and motivation on the field.[63] Writing for The New York Times, Huw Richards noted Kohli's 
        self-assuredness and "assertiveness" in contrast to some former Indian cricketers who he felt had exhibited an inclination towards excessive politeness and reticence, and that Kohli embodies his combative demeanour both on and off the cricket field.</p>
